## Code Cleanliness Analysis ✅

### Large Files Assessment (>500 lines)

The automated report identified 9 files exceeding 500 lines. All files are justified:

| File | Lines | Assessment | Justification |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| pf-runner/pf_grammar.py | 3,558 | ✅ Acceptable | Auto-generated by Lark parser v1.3.0 |
| pf-runner/pf_tui.py | 1,279 | ✅ Acceptable | Terminal UI with extensive features |
| pf-runner/pf_containerize.py | 1,267 | ✅ Acceptable | Comprehensive container management |
| pf-runner/pf_parser.py | 1,243 | ✅ Acceptable | Complex parsing logic for DSL |
| fabric/connection.py | 1,115 | ✅ Acceptable | SSH connection management (external lib) |
| pf-runner/pf_prune.py | 625 | ✅ Acceptable | Git repository pruning logic |
| pf-runner/pf_main.py | 580 | ✅ Acceptable | Main application entry point |
| tools/debugging/fuzzing/in_memory_fuzzer.py | 564 | ✅ Acceptable | Comprehensive fuzzing tool |
| fabric/testing/base.py | 543 | ✅ Acceptable | Testing framework (external lib) |

**Conclusion:** No refactoring required. All large files serve legitimate purposes:
- 1 file is auto-generated and should not be modified
- 2 files are from external libraries (Fabric)
- 6 files represent complex domains requiring extensive code (TUI, parsing, containers, fuzzing)

**Previous Assessment:** The December 19, 2025 review reached the same conclusion with a detailed analysis showing 95% test coverage and excellent code organization.
