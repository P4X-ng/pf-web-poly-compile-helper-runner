3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

- Follow existing formatting conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run specific test suites
npm run test          # Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests
npm run test:tui      # TUI tests
npm run test:grammar  # Grammar tests
```

### Writing Tests

- Place E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`
- Place unit tests in appropriate subdirectories under `tests/`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Debug Playwright tests
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Update QUICKSTART.md for user-facing changes
- Add to docs/ for new features or guides
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Task File Contributions

When contributing new pf tasks:

- Use descriptive task names
- Include `describe` for all tasks
- Follow established DSL patterns
- Test tasks thoroughly
