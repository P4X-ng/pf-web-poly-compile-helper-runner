## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of pf-web-poly-compile-helper-runner is important to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. Opening a GitHub Security Advisory at: https://github.com/P4X-ng/pf-web-poly-compile-helper-runner/security/advisories/new
2. Or by creating a private issue with the `security` label and marking it as confidential

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will send you regular updates about our progress, at least every 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report
2. Investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. Work on a fix and coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
4. Release a security update
5. Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (if you wish)

## Security Best Practices

When using pf-web-poly-compile-helper-runner:

### Container Security

- Always run containers with appropriate security contexts
- Use read-only filesystems where possible
- Limit container capabilities to minimum required
- Keep container base images up to date

### Code Execution

- Be cautious when executing untrusted code with polyglot shell support
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to pf tasks
- Use containers or sandboxes for executing untrusted code
- Review Pfyfile configurations before execution

### Debugging and Development

- Do not expose debugging ports to untrusted networks
- Use strong authentication for remote debugging sessions
- Be aware that debugging tools (GDB, LLDB, etc.) can expose sensitive information

### Binary Injection and Exploitation Tools

- This repository includes educational tools for binary exploitation
- These tools should only be used in authorized testing environments
- Never use exploitation tools on systems without explicit permission
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities discovered

### REST API Security

- Use authentication and authorization for production deployments
- Bind API server to localhost (127.0.0.1) unless remote access is required
- Use HTTPS/TLS for remote API access
- Implement rate limiting and request validation

## Known Security Considerations

### Educational Security Tools

This repository contains educational tools for:
- Binary exploitation (ROP chains, buffer overflows)
- Kernel debugging and fuzzing
- Code injection techniques
- Web security testing

**Important**: These tools are for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

### Polyglot Shell Execution

The polyglot shell feature allows executing code in 40+ languages. This is powerful but requires careful handling:
- Always validate and sanitize code before execution
- Use containers or sandboxes for untrusted code
- Be aware of the security implications of executing user-provided code

### Container and Privilege Escalation

Some features require elevated privileges or container runtime access. Always:
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Review container configurations before deployment
- Use rootless containers where possible

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security vulnerability report, we follow these steps:

1. **Confirmation**: Confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity
2. **Development**: Develop and test a fix
3. **Release**: Release security updates
4. **Announcement**: Publish a security advisory with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Affected versions
   - Fixed versions
   - Workarounds (if available)
   - Credit to the reporter (with permission)

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- Patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1) for critical security fixes
- Minor versions (e.g., 1.1.0) for security enhancements
